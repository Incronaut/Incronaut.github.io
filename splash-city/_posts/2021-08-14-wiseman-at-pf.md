James Wiseman. The Unicorn. In 2020, this unique prospect was drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the #2 pick.  Standing tall at 7', the Warriors, who lacked a Center with height, used their pick on this 19 year old at the time to help fill out their roster.  Wiseman was a risky draft pick with only 3 college games under his belt.  The Warriors understood the risks, hoping that he could have some level of contribution right away, but ultimately knowing that he will be a long-term development project with a really high skill ceiling.  This man just oozes potential.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wiseman">He averaged in college 19.7 PPG and 10.3 RPG</a>, and although it was only three games, you can see that he has the physical gifts, the work ethic, and the right attitude to become a true ballin' star in the future.

His first year, however, was a rocky start for his career.  THe Warriors <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021/on-off/">had the worst ORtg in the league with Wiseman on the court (103.0)</a> (OKC had the lowest ORtg in the league at 103.5.) When Wiseman was off the floor, the Warriors ranked 10th with a ORtg 114.2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/myz09p/since_wisemans_injury_the_warriors_are_ranked_1/"> with stretches of being #4 in Ortg and #1 in overall rating without him.</a>  From the Reddit link, "They ended up with 116.7 OFFRTG, 104.9 DEFRTG, and 11.8 NETRTG in the 9 games stretch."

Could Wiseman have played better? Obviously.  Does Wiseman have a lot of room to improve both physically and mentally?  Most definitely.  But could it be both the short-term and long-term interest of all parties involved for Wiseman to be playing at Power Forward?  Maybe.  Is it possible for the Dubs to be utilizing Wiseman's strengths better?  Potentially.

Now to start, what are the main differences when comparing Power Forward and Center?  Centers tend to be a much more physical position: fighting in the paint, pushing for rebounds, and scrapping for points.  Power Forward also has a lot of physicality involved, but they usually are a little smaller and tend to play a little farther out at the high post.  Caveat: In today's era of basketball, positions are a lot less defined.  Centers can stretch the floor.  Point Guards can be grabbing rebounds.  But even then, one can say that the general trend is that Centers are bigger than Power Forwards.

I don't want to add to many disclaimers into this post, but I feel this one has to be said:  Wiseman is perfectly capable at playing and excelling at Center.  He can post up.  He has the height play in the low post.  And this summer he has been seen with a definite size increase and looking to have packed on some muscle.

But is it optimal? I have three main points I want to throw out there as to why it's worth considering putting Wiseman at PF:

<b>Size</b>
Wiseman is tall.  And the Warriors desperately need that height down low.  While true, Wiseman's size compared the other great bigs don't seem to matchup.  I do think with Wiseman lifting weights and still being young, he can grow to become the Center that GSW needs, but as of the end of the 2021 sesason, I just don't see it.  Here are the comparisons I made:

<b>Playstyle</b>

<b>Longevity</b>
