ReleasedJul 16, 2015

Warnings: Spoilers for E3 2015. This is our very first non-interview episode of NPC Talk! Although for a majority of our episodes we like to talk about

some of the greatest games released, here on NPC Talk we try to dive into everything related to video games, including news and events that affect the future.  So for today&#39;s

episode we talk about the annually anticipated event E3, where many companies share their plans for the following year and announce exciting titles.  With Anthony and Roger

joining me, we share our thoughts on why some of the announcements are revolutionary, and why others fail our expectations.  Because the event had so much going on

simultaneously, we weren&#39;t able to cover absolutely everything (although admittedly I cut the episode a bit short), but we do a fine job of describing the bulk of the news and we

hope it&#39;s enough to spark interest for the next gaming year.  Below is a brief list of what we cover: Sony 1. The Last Guardian 2. Shenmue 3 3. Final Fantasy VII Remake 4.

Kingdom Hearts 3 5. Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness 6. Horizon: Zero Dawn Microsoft 1. Xbox One updates (backwards compatibility, new controller) 2. Dark Souls 3,

Assassin&#39;s Creed: Syndicate (Roger wanted to mention it), Halo 5 (all needed embellishment) 3. ReCore 4. Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter Nintendo 1. Why Nintendo E3 was a

disappointment (Zelda announcement, Metroid Federation Force) 2. Mario announcements (Mario and Luigi Paper Jam, Super Mario Maker) Recording date: 06-24- 2015
