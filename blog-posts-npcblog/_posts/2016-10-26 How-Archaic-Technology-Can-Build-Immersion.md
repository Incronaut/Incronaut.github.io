The human psyche is an extraordinary thing.  On one hand, we're simple creatures that love the good and hate the bad.  On the other, we like to feel rewarded for the hardwork we do, even if that work doesn't always make the most sense.  Let's be clear about one thing right now, I'm not a professional psychologist.  I'm not even a psychology major.  But there have been trends throughout the history of gaming that have led me to believe that simple features and technology may be the some of the best ways for players to feel as though they really do belong to a fictional, virtual universe.

Again, a caveat.  This article isn't written to say that technology is bad.  The opposite is true.  So many quality of life improvements have made many many games much better.  In League of Legends, your champion's health bar was displayed in a different color than everyone else's, which made distinguishing your character much easier.  In Halo 2, they added the ability to dual wield guns and had a bigger arsenal for more varied play.  The list goes on and on forever.  However, at this time, I will be diving in to a very small crevice in gaming where the oddity of simple functions made a game so beautiful.

First off.  Traversal.  This is already a hotly debated topic in game design and can go in two different ways.  Let's use Bethesda Game Studios' beautiful Morrowind as an example.  The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, a highly respected game known for its incredible depth, its wide array of gameplay content, and its flawless immersion.  One aspect about Morrowind was that a lot of the time a player spends in the game is traveling from one location to another.  Players have complained that traveling in this game takes far too long, and can eventually fall into yawn inducing tedium.  A boring mechanic that only inflates gametime hours for moneymaking statistics.
