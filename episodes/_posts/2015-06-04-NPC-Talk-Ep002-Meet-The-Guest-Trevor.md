Warnings: Possible spoilers on Top 3 games. Here on Episode 2 of our newly named podcast NPC Talk, we have another new guest Trevor (also

later referred to as Zirc, but the same person!).  We also have a new intro and outro song for the podcast, written by yours truly (me).  In this episode, Trevor discusses some of

his Top 3 games, which are: Chrono Trigger, Jet Set Radio, and Mirror&#39;s Edge.  As we dive further into the podcast and star different guests, we start seeing the variances in

what people value in games, as well as many interesting similarities.  One thing I found really neat about Trevor&#39;s specific Top 3 is his focus on games that have incredibly

strong ties to their core theme or idea. These games tend to do really well against the test of time and create a special level of immersion that many other games cannot

compare.  Trevor, along with his spot on analysis, articulates his thoughts very clearly, and has a lovely voice to boot.  Speaking of which, quality upgrades and fixes are a never

ending process, but are definitely under construction for this episode.  Great to have Trevor on the show, and we will definitely hear from him again! Recording date: 06-04- 2015
